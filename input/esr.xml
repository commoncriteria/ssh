		<!-- This section sets the context for not only the ESR, but what is 
			expected of the resulting Protection Profile (PP). The intent is 
			that the remaining sections provide succinct statements that 
			highlight the relevant aspects to be addressed by the Technical 
			Community (TC) constructing the PP. Here, the authors provide a 
			narrative that introduces the reader to the problem being solved, 
			and presents key aspects that support or guide the TC, and may
			elaborate on subtleties not apparent in the “bulleted” high level

				<li>Hardware devices, such as routers and switches</li>

	<section title="Attacker access" id="attackeraccess"> The following assumptions are made about
		attackers' ability to develop attacks: <ul>
			<li> An attacker has an arbitrary amount of time to analyze the behavior of SSH, its
				interaction with its platform, and the data it transmits over the network. </li>
			<li> An attacker is able to acquire their own copy of the target software and study its
				behavior on a platform that they control. </li>
		</ul>
		<p/> The attacker is expected to engage in the following general classes of attack: <!-- added in order to allow for rather direct flow to Threats section in PP -->
		<ul>
			<li> Network eavesdropping, in which an attacker may monitor and gain access to data
				exchanged between the SSH Clients and other endpoints. </li>
			<li> Network attack, in which an attacker may initiate malicious communications with an SSH Client
				or alter communications between the SSH Client and other endpoints. </li>
			<li> Local attack, in which an attacker has gained the ability to execute code on the
				system, which may be used to escalate privilege or access data without
				authorization. </li>
		</ul>

	<section title="Essential Security Requirements" id="requirements">
		<!--
        	This is where the authors present an initial set of English 
        	requirements that specify security functionality, rather than 
        	design and/or implementation characteristics. These requirements 
        	will provide the foundation for which the detailed set of 
        	requirements is derived. It is important that the requirements 
        	captured here make an attempt to fully address the categories 
        	(e.g., access control, identification and authentication, 
        	management capabilities, roles of administration, secure 
        	communications, and audit). That's not to say the requirements are 
        	fully specified or detailed enough to simply translate to Common 
        	Criteria security functional requirements. The goal is that there 
        	is enough information contained here, as well as the other sections
        	of this document, to provide the TC enough information to ensure 
        	they have an understanding of what is minimally required in breath.
        -->
		<p> The following are the essential security requirements expected to be implemented by an
			SSH Client within the established scope: 
			<ul>
				<li>SSH software shall implement the SSH protocol that complies with RFCs</li>
				<li>Support authentication methods as described in RFC 4252: public key-based, password-based</li>
				<li>SSH transport implementation uses the following encryption algorithms:
					<ul>
					  <li>aes128-cbc</li>
					  <li>aes256-cbc</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>SSH connection be rekeyed after no more than 2^28packets have been transmitted</li>
			</ul>

	<section title="Assumptions" id="assumptions">
		<!--
			Simply put, this section presents the aspects of the product and 
			its	intended environment that can be assumed to hold true. This 
			will provide additional scope on the resulting PP.
		-->
		The following assumptions are made for the operating system product and its operational
		environment: <ul>
			<li>The underlying platform is physically protected, to a large extent. The hardware
				that the OS manages is secured by defensive measures that make physical attacks
				impractical for most attackers. At the same time, casual passersby might attempt to
				trivially access the system. </li>
			<li>The OS implements some security-relevant functionality that does not require
				evaluation (e.g., network time synchronization, process scheduling, and virtual
				memory management including process separation). </li>
			<li>Depending on configuration and capability, the OS may or may not be: <ul>
					<li>configuration-managed by the enterprise</li>
					<li>bound to directory services to support multi-user login</li> These do not
					fundamentally increase or decrease overall risk exposure, and represent
					operational choices. </ul>
			</li>
			<li> The OS runs application software developed by a third-party. The applications are
				not intentionally developed to be malicious, but can contain inadvertent coding
				errors. These errors introduce risk that control of an application may be seized by
				a malicious entity. The OS shall confine these applications within the originally
				designated operating environment. </li>
			<li>The platform is connected to a network. For purposes of sending/receiving data, to
				include software updates, the platform is connected to other entities. Other
				entities on the network are not inherently trustable. </li>
			<li>Administrators are not malicious in nature.</li>
			<li> Users are not malicious in nature. </li>

		<!--
			This is where the authors explicitly state things they do not want 
			to be considered for inclusion in an evaluation against a 
			resulting PP.  Items expressed here could include threats, 
			functions or capabilities that would require assurance activities 
			that are too subjective, or specific expertise not available in the
			evaluation facilities expected to assess products against the PP 
			(e.g., assessing anti-tamper measures). 
		-->
		The following list contains items that are explicitly out-of-scope for any evaluation
		against the OS PP <ul>
			<li>Malicious, Highly-Privileged Administrators - Highly-privileged administrators
				acting maliciously can disable most, if not all, security protections on the OS.
				Additionally procedural controls that are out of scope of this document should be
				considered to help highlight administrator accounts acting suspiciously.</li>
			<li>Zero Days - The disclosure of recently published vulnerabilities (Zero Days) should
				not be used as a reason to fail an OS undergoing evaluation.</li>
			<li>Unofficial Versions - Non-vendor supplied install images often contain added
				functionality and may weaken the normal operating functionality of the OS</li>
			<li>Platform - The OS PP shall not address the hardware or firmware of the underlying
				platform to include the boot sequence before control is handed off to the OS. That
				the platform itself is virtual or physical is irrelevant to any evaluations. </li>
			<li>Applications - The OS PP shall not address applications that are not delivered as
				part of the OS installation process. </li>
